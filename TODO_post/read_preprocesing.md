Pre-processing is an umbrella term that can mean filtering out / trimming low quality reads and reads contaminated with adapter sequences, and / or correcting for sequencing baises such as batch or lane effects.

## Sequencing Biases

- **Batch effects** include any errors that occur after random fragmentation of the DNA until it is input to the flow cell.
  - e.g., PCR amplification and reverse transcription artifacts.
- **Lane effects** include any errors that occur from the point at which the sample is input to the flow cell until data are output from the sequencing machine.
  - e.g., systematically bad sequencing cycles and errors in base calling.

## Ways to Trim Reads

- Hard Trim
  - Cut off reads after certain number of bases
  - Computational easy
  - Makes all reads same length
- Soft Trim
  - Trimming that considers quality scores in a sliding window that is usually ~10bp wide
  - Tools that do this
    - Sickle from UC Davis Bioinformatics

## Sequence Duplicaiton

- Duplicates should be remeved
- There are two ways duplication can happen:
  - PCR duplication from uneven amplification
  - Optical duplication
    - One sequencing colony can look like two colonies to the sequencing machine
    - Illumina made this less of an issue on the NovaSeq by adding millions of microwells to the flowcells

## Adapter trimming

- Adapters are almost always trimmed from 3’ end instead of 5’ end. Illumina reads don’t need to have the 5’ end adapter trimmed because there is a primer sequence that binds to the 5’ end and sequencing by synthesis begins with the first base on the DNA insert.
- Most adapter trimmers will take into account the quiality of the sequences on the 3' end to better determine whether there is adapter sequence or not
- It's good practice to run FASTQC before and after trimming for comparison

## Most popular pre-processors

### Skewer

- 2015
- Adapter trimmer
- Less popular, but cited in good papers indicating quality
- Not maintained, git issues are more or less ignored
- Poor documentation

### Trimmomatic

- 2014
- Adapter trimmer for Illumina reads
- Fairly documented
- Not actively maintained by main developer
- Somewhat maintained by other unrelated contributors
- Popular, praised in the community

### Cutadapt

- 2011
- Adapter trimmer
- Well documented
- Actively maintained
- Some doubts about quality in the community

### Fastp

- 2018
- https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp
- All around pre-processor, many utilities
- Very fast, supposedly 2x-5x faster than other pre-processors / trimmers
- Well documented
- Actively maintained. 800 stars on Github, >100 issues, > 100 issues resolved
- Hot right now

You can find at least one source for each that argues it is the best adapter / pre-processing tool. I have highest hopes for fastp.
