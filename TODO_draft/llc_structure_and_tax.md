# Idaho Single Member LLC Taxation Options

## Taxed as a Sole Proprietorship or Disregarded Entity

The business profits pass through to the owner. They are reported on Schedule C of the owner’s 1040 form. They are subject to regular income tax (idaho 2-6%) and self employment tax (idaho 15.3%)

## Taxed as an S Corporation

As an S Corp, the LLC must put the owner on payroll. When the S Corp pays the owner, the money is divided between the owner’s wages and the owner’s dividends.

The wages are subject to income tax and FICA taxes (total 15.3%, S Corp pays 7.65% which it can write off as a business expense, and you pay the other 7.65% which is withheld from your paycheck).

The owner’s dividends are only subject to income tax (Idaho 2-6%) only. And that is the advantage of an S Corp.

The IRS requires that the S Corp member being paid gets a reasonable salary before getting the remainder of the money as a dividend.

# EIN

An Idaho single member LLC does not have to have an EIN. It only needs one if it plans to have employees, establish business credit, or a few other cases.

If an LLC wants to elect S Corporation tax status, it needs an EIN.

# S Corporation Important Details

When the business transfers money to the owner, it is treated as wages by default. This is regardless of whether the business was majorly profitable or had a net loss. If money flows from the business to the owner, it’s considered wages on which taxes are owed.

## Loan

If you loan the business money and later have the business pay you back, the money the business pays you back will be classified as wages.

If you want the money the S Corp pays you back to be classified as a loan repayment so that you dont have to pay taxes on it, then you need to document your loan and the business loan repayment like this

- The corporation should make interest payments and provide security.
- You should use a formal loan agreement.
- The written document should have a fixed maturity date.
