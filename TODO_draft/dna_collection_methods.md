Hi folks, today I am going to compare three methods for collection DNA from a person: blood, swab, and saliva. Stick around to the end to hear which method which consumer DNA company is using and which I recommend.

Before we do the comparison, we need talk about what makes a great DNA sample. Because quality data, starts with a quality sample. There are three factors that determine the quality of a DNA sample: amount, purity, and the degree of degradation. Lets talk about why these matter.

The amount of DNA in the sample matters because once the amount dips below the amount required for sequencing, then the sample DNA needs to be amplified. Amplifying DNA is basically the process of making copies of the DNA in the sample. But the problem is, there is no such thing as unbiased DNA amplification. Some pieces of the sample DNA will be amplified more than others, which will inevitably skew the results of sequencing. That is why its much better to start with enough sample DNA so that amplification isn't required.

Next, the purity. What do we mean when we say sample purity? We mean how much of the sample DNA is actually from the person we are testing instead of another source like bacteria. The more bacterial DNA in the sample, the more likely it is for that bacterial DNA to make it into the sequencing process and affect the results. So we want as little bacterial DNA in the sample as possible.

Finally, DNA degradation. DNA degradation means anything that damages the quality of the DNA polymer. This could be breaks in the phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule, damage to individual bases, or breaks between individual nucleotides. DNA degradation usually happens when the sample isn't stored properly or is subjected to cycles of freezing and thawing. DNA degradation is bad for obvious reasons. If the DNA is damaged it is difficult to accurately sequence because the sequencing process depends on the effective binding of nucleotides to the DNA in order to read out the sequence. If the sample DNA is damaged, there will be problems with nucleotides binding to it, and therefore the sequence cannot be read.

So the best possible DNA sample would be one with lots of non-degraded DNA and very little contamination. Now that we understand the goal, lets look at three of the most popular methods for DNA collection today: blood, swab, and saliva.

## Blood

The most classical method for DNA collection is blood. Blood has long been thought of as the gold standard source for DNA, and there are a few reasons for this. One is that most of the DNA you extract from blood is coming from white blood cells, which are known to be high quality sources for genomic DNA. Another reason is that there is very limited bacterial DNA in a blood sample.

So if blood is such a great source for human DNA, why are we even discussing other methods? It comes down to invasiveness and logistics of taking a blood sample. First, lots of people aren't fond of needles and their dislike of needles will actually deter them from getting the test. Another problem is that drawing blood currently requires a trained phlebotomist, which usually means that the person getting tested needs to go to a clinic to have their blood drawn, they can't do it at home. Finally, once taken, a blood sample needs to be stored at –15 to –25˚C to avoid DNA degradation, which obviously requires the sample to be on ice. But during shipping, especially if there are delays, you can imagine the temperature of the sample getting above -15C.

So to recap, blood is a great source of high quality genomic DNA. However, getting blood is invasive and more logistically complex than alternatives.

## Cheek Swab

Next lets consider cheek swabs. You have probably seen them being used in crime shows or in the media. To use a cheek swab you simply run cotton end up and down the inside of your cheeks and then place the swab in a sterile plastic bag or tube for storage.

Unlike blood where DNA is derived from white blood cells, DNA from swab samples is primarily derived from buccal cells, which are the cells lining your check walls. In terms of amount of DNA that a buccal swab can yield, studies differ in their reports. However it is clear that a buccal swabs yield much less DNA than a blood or saliva sample.

In terms of purity, its estimated that the amount of bacterial DNA in a buccal swab sample can exceed 80%. This is simply due to the fact that your check walls are home to lots of bacteria. In addition to bacteria, buccal swab samples generally have greater protein and salt contamination than blood or saliva samples.

Finally, buccal samples can be stored between 2 to 3 weeks at cool or room temperatures. However to really avoid degradation, its recommended that they are stored around 4 degrees Celsius for no more than two weeks before DNA extraction. So for best results they should be kept quite cool. Unlike blood or saliva, buccal swab samples only last a few weeks, after which there is too much DNA degradation.

So overall, buccal swabs are a quick and easy way of getting a DNA sample. However, they yield much less DNA, are much less pure than other types of samples, and are susceptible to DNA degradation at warm temperatures or storage periods longer than two weeks.

Also fun fact, medical buccal swabs were shown to yield no more DNA than drugstore cotton swabs.

## Saliva

Finally lets talk about saliva.

Saliva sample kits usually look like this. To give your sample, you need to spit out 2 mL of saliva into the tube. When you're done spitting, you close the cap, releasing the buffer which stabilizes the DNA in your saliva, protecting it from degradation.

It is uniformly agreed that saliva samples yield large amounts of genomic DNA. It has even been estimated that to collect the equivalent amount of DNA in one saliva sample, you would need to collect over 200 buccal swabs. And despite coming from the mouth, like the buccal swab method, 74% of the DNA extracted from saliva comes from white blood cells. So in that capacity, it is similar to a blood sample. Because of this, its understood that saliva samples yield equivalent quality DNA to blood samples.

In terms of purity, its estimated that saliva samples contain 11% bacterial DNA and have very limited protein and or salt contamination.

Most impressively however, saliva samples can be stored long term at room temperature with minimal to no DNA degradation. This is because of the stabilization buffer that is mixed and with the saliva. The buffer protects the DNA molecules from degradation by DNA breaking proteins in the sample and in general helps to stabilize the molecule.

So in terms of amount and purity, a saliva sample is more or less equivalent to a blood sample. However, it is much easier to prevent DNA degradation in a saliva sample than a blood sample. Finally, saliva samples are noninvasive and more logistically simple to collect and store than the other sampling methods.

## My recommendation

At this point, you can probably tell that I recommend the saliva sampling method over others. Specifically I recommend the saliva kits from Oragene. They are not sponsoring this video, I just really like their kits. There are numerous studies that support the quality of their kits.

## Which company uses which method?

Typically when a DNA test is ordered by a physician, a blood sample will be taken.

Direct to consumer genomics companies however usually use the buccal swab or saliva methods for their convenience.

CircleDNA, FamilyTree DNA, and labcorp use buccal swabs.
23andME, AncestryDNA, Guardiome, and a few others use saliva samples.
