## Ingredients

1 lb (500 g) Ground Beef

2 tbsp Cooking oil

1 Onion (chopped)

1 tbsp Garlic (minced)

1 tbsp Ginger (grated)

2 tbsp Tomatoes paste

2 tbsp Curry powder

1 tsp Cayenne or sweet paprika (2 tsp to make it spicy)

1 tsp Garam masala

½ cup Coconut milk (or ¼ cup coconut cream)

1 cup Broth or stock (chicken or beef )

1 tsp Salt

½ tsp Black pepper

2 tbsp Lemon juice

1 cup Cilantro or parsley (chopped)

## Instructions

In a saute pan or cast-iron skillet, saute onion in the oil over medium heat for two minutes until translucent. Then, add the ground beef and stir on medium high heat until its no longer pink.

Pro tip – Cook the onions on medium-low letting them sweat and lightly caramelize. Browning the beef adds a nice caramelization.

Add the ginger and garlic. Saute for 2 minutes. Then, add the tomato paste, curry powder, cayenne, and garam masala. Saute well for 2 to 3 mins on low until fragrant.

Pro tip – Saute these ingredients until a nice aroma comes from the spices.

Next, add the coconut milk and chicken stock. Season with salt, pepper, and add the chopped cilantro or parsley and lemon juice. Bring to a boil.

Pro tip – Adding water to the ground beef will prevent lumps during cooking.

Once the mixture comes to a boil, lower the heat and cover the pot with a lid. Simmer on medium-low heat for 15 minutes.

Pro tip – When cooked, you will see the oil from the recipe float to the top of the curry.

Taste and adjust seasoning and consistency.

Pro tip – If you are serving chicken curry with rice, you may want to have some gravy. So, add a little water and bring to a boil. And if you're serving mince curry with chapati a thicker consistency is preferable.

Sprinkle with more chopped cilantro before you serve.
