## Ingredients

1 lb beef, thinly sliced (450g)

1 oz ginger root, thinly sliced, 2" long pieces (about 30g)

1 cup water (240cc)

4 Tbsp soy sauce

3 Tbsp sugar

1 Tbsp Sake

1 Tbsp Mirin

## Instructions

Slice beef and ginger root into thin slices.

Heat water in a pot, and add cut ginger and the rest of the ingredients (except beef).

When the water boils, add beef and stir so the beef doesn't bunch up. Let it boil and skim fat well.

Cook covered for 20-30 minutes. Uncover and continue to cook until liquid is almost all gone.
