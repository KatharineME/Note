## Ingredients

1 cup (240ml) warm water

20g salt

400g all purpose flour

## Instructions

Mix warm water and salt well until the salt is dissolved.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, add salt water and flour. Mix with a dough hook at medium speed about 5 minutes.

Wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest at least 3 hours in the refrigerator (preferably overnight).

Take the cold dough from the refrigerator and let it return to room temperature.

Remove from plastic and knead by hand for a couple of minutes until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.

Cover and let it rest for 20 minutes.

Put the dough in a strong 1 gallon plastic bag (such as a zip freezer bag), leaving it at least partly open to allow air to escape. Then put the bag of dough on the floor. Step on the bag of dough and knead with your feet until the dough spreads out, taking up the whole bag. Take the dough out and fold in half twice, into a smaller square. Repeat this kneading and folding 2 more times.

Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest 20 minutes.

Roll out the dough to 3 mm (1/8") thick about the size of 50cm x 35cm (20" x14") sheet, dusting well with a lot of flour so that it doesn't stick, and fold the dough into 3 layers.

Cut the dough to 3 mm width noodles.

Boil water in a big pot, and boil the noodles for 10-15 minutes.

Strain and wash. Use as directed in recipes.
