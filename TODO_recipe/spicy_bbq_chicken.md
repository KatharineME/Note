## Ingredients

2 pounds chicken drumettes

½ cup whole milk (optional)

6 garlic cloves, minced

1 teaspoon minced ginger

2 green onions, chopped

½ cup Korean hot pepper paste

⅓ cup rice syrup (or ¼ cup sugar)

2 tablespoons Korean Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)

1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil

½ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Directions

#### Prep the chicken, if using milk:

Put the chicken in a bowl, add milk and mix it together by hand.

Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

#### Make the spicy paste:

Combine garlic, ginger, green onion, hot pepper paste, rice syrup, hot pepper flakes, toasted sesame oil, and black pepper in a bowl and mix it well with a spoon.

Strain the chicken and squeeze a little to remove any excess milk. Put it in a large bowl.

Add the paste and mix it well by hand. Refrigerate for 10 to 30 minutes.

#### BBQ chicken

Grill or BBQ the chicken on medium heat for 30 minutes, or until well cooked. Keep flipping the drumettes over with your tongs so they don’t burn on the grill. Brush on any remaining hot sauce after the first turn over.

Serve with rice and other side dishes.
