## Ingredients

4 large ripe tomatoes

1/2 large red onion

2 large cucumbers

1 cup Kalamata olives

4 ounces high quality feta cheese: crumbled, cut into squares, or in a block (Greek feta, if you can find it!)

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 tablespoon red wine vinegar

1 teaspoon dried oregano

2 tablespoons capers (optional)

Kosher salt

## Instructions

Chop the tomatoes into rough chunks; remove and discard the seeds. Place the tomatoes in a large bowl and add a few pinches of kosher salt.

Thinly slice the red onion. Peel alternating strips from the cucumbers, making a striped pattern with the peel (alternatively, remove the peel entirely). Cut the cucumbers in half and use a spoon to remove the seeds; then, cut them into Â½-inch pieces.

In a large bowl, combine the tomatoes, red onion, and cucumbers with the Kalamata olives, feta cheese crumbles, olive oil, and red wine vinegar. If desired, add the dried oregano and capers. Gently mix to combine.

Serve immediately, or let sit at room temperature for several minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
