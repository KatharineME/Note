Regular elk meat stew...

I use fairly large pieces...2 inches at least as it shrinks when cooked...

Flour it and spice it and, again, into a deep heavy pot, where it's browned again.

Add onions and garlic...chopped small...and brown.

Add red wine (or apple juice) and stock to cover and put into the oven at same temp (325 to 350).

Cook two or three hours, until tender, checking fluid level.

Again, I serve with potatoes and red cabbage.
