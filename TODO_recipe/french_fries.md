## Ingredients

4 large baking potatoes

2-3 tablespoons olive oil

1 tablespoon seasoned salt or lemon pepper

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 375°F.

Wash potatoes leaving skin on (you can peel them if you prefer). Cut potatoes into desired size fries.

Let potatoes soak in cold water in the sink or in a bowl for at least 30 minutes. Remove from water and dry very well.

Toss with oil and seasonings. Spread evenly in a single layer on a parchment-lined pan.

Bake for 20 minutes. Turn the oven up to 425° and cook fries until golden, about 20-25 minutes more.
