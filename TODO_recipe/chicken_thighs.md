## Ingredients

6 boneless chicken thighs, about 1 Â½ pounds\*

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

1/2 teaspoon onion powder

1/2 teaspoon paprika

Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 tablespoon butter

1 small shallot, minced

3 cloves garlic, minced

1/2 cup chicken broth

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

2 sprigs fresh thyme

1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

1/3 cup heavy cream

Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish

## Instructions

Use a paper towel to pat the chicken thighs dry.

In a small bowl, combine the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Rub the seasoning mixture all over the chicken thighs, on both sides.

Heat a large cast iron to medium heat and add the olive oil.

Place chicken thighs skin side down in the hot skillet and cook, until skin is crispy about 5 minutes, flip chicken thighs and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes or until internal temp is 165 degrees. Transfer chicken to a plate.

Add the butter, shallot, and garlic to the skillet. Cook for 1 minute. Stir in the chicken broth, lemon juice, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Reduce heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until sauce thickens up a bit.

Place the chicken back in the pan with the sauce. Garnish with fresh parsley. Serve the chicken warm with the sauce.

## Notes

You can use skin-on or skinless chicken thighs, whatever you prefer.

You can use chicken breasts, but the thighs are juicier.

Store leftover chicken thighs in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
