## Ingredients

1 can of unsalted corn (15¼ ounces, or 432 grams), strained with the excess water squeezed out

¾ cup of chopped onion, red bell pepper (or carrot), and green bell pepper mixed together

pinch of kosher salt

1 tablespoon unsalted butter

1/4 cup mayonnaise

1 tablespoon sugar

5 to 6 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced thinly

2 ounces white rice cake, sliced into small pieces

## Directions

Combine the chopped onion, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and a pinch of salt in a bowl and mix them well. Let it sit for 5 minutes before wrapping it all in a cotton cloth and squeezing out the excess water.

Heat up an oven-safe, heavy skillet or pan and add the butter and corn. Stir and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the corn absorbs all the butter. Add the vegetables and stir for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and cool it down a little.

Add the mayonnaise and sugar and mix well.

Add the cheese on top of the corn and the rice cake on top of the cheese.

Cover and cook over low heat for 7 or 8 minutes, or until the cheese melts, and serve right away.
