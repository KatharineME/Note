## Ingredients

12 large egg yolks room temp

3 cups all-purpose flour

2 and ½ teaspoon baking powder

½ teaspoon salt

1 cup granulated sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla

1 teaspoon lemon extract (or 1 lemon squeezed)

1 cup cold water

## Instructions

Prepare a 10-inch (12 cup) tube pan or 12 cup bundt pan with non-stick spray.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. (I recommend you Calibrate your oven!)

Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together.

In a mixing bowl, beat egg yolks until very fluffy and thick.

Gradually beat in sugar and beat 2 minutes on high speed, stopping to scrape the bowl.

Reduce speed to low and add vanilla, lemon, and cold water.

Gradually, but quickly add sifted flour mixture while beating on low, scrape bowl.

Beat only long enough to blend, about 2 minutes.

Pour batter into prepared pan.

Bake 50 to 60 minutes or until golden brown or when pick inserted in thickest portion of the cake comes out clean or with dry crumbs. (Watch closely if you haven't calibrated your oven. Baking pans can affect baking times as well. If it turns out dry you cooked it too long.)

Cool cake for 15 minutes on wire rack before removing from the pan. Loosen sides of cake from pan with a spatula, then remove from pan. Cool completely on wire rack.

Store in an airtight container 4 days or on countertop or 1 week in the refrigerator.
