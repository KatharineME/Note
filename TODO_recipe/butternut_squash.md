## Ingredients

1 medium (2-3 pounds) butternut squash

4 tablespoons olive oil

1 teaspoon salt

½ teaspoon cracked black pepper - or ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning - or Herbs de Provence

1 teaspoon garlic powder

4 tablespoons butter - optional

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 degrees and grease a large baking sheet.

Peel butternut squash (with a regular peeler), slice down the middle lengthwise. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and innards and discard. Chop into 1-inch pieces and arrange in a single layer on prepared baking sheet.

Drizzle olive oil over squash, then use spoons or your hands to toss the squash to coat in the olive oil.

Season with salt, pepper, dried herbs, and garlic powder.

Bake for 20-25 minutes until squash is very tender and begins to brown on the edges. Serve immediately, or if using the butter, proceed with the next step.

Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and continue to cook just until butter darkens from pale yellow to a dark golden color. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl.

Spoon browned butter over squash and serve immediately.
