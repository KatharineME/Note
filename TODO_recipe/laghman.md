Serving: 6

## Ingredients

#### Stew

1 tablespoon of diced onion

1 pound of lamb, cubed, it is ok to have some bones

1 medium size potato, thinly sliced

3 leaves of Chinese cabbage, sliced lengthwise or into cubes

5 long green beans, cut into about 1 inch long

1 bell pepper, cubed

3 tomatoes, diced

8 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced

1/2 cup of diced parsley, chopped into 1/2 inch long

salt to taste

2 teaspoon of ground cumin

1/2 cup of olive oil

#### Dough

2 cups of non-bleached all purpose flour. I used Gold medal brand, premium quality flour

(1.5 teaspoon less than 2/3 cup) of water

1/2 teaspoon salt

olive oil as needed

#### Bioling Noodle

4 cups of water

3/4 to 1 teaspoon salt, or add to taste

## Instructions

#### Dough mixing

1. Add the salt with flour in a bowl, mix well, then add water step wise while mixing. Try to mix harder with hand at start. Also by the end, be careful to use less and less water each time. Water should be enough to mix the dough, but not too much. If you don't use up all water, don't worry. You may need some for kneading

2. After mixing the dough well, smooth the dough by kneading with fists and folding for about 5 min.(These two steps can be done by kitchen aid), you can also add tiny bit water to smooth some uneven surface of the dough while kneading. Be careful not to accidentally add too much water. It is better you had your water in a container, you make your hand wet a little bit by dipping your hand into the water, then continue kneading and folding. Make sure your dough is completely smooth.

3. Spray some vegetable oil on top of dough, cover the dough with plastic wrap first, then towel on top, let sit for 30 min at room temperature

#### Stew

1. Heat the cooking pan with high heat.

2. Add oil in the cooking pan, heat at high heat

3. When oil is hot, add onion to the cooking pan, stir briefly

4. Right away, add lamb, stir fry often until all sides of lamb turns brown, add 1 teaspoons of salt. Add cumin. It is important to add some salt right after lamb, otherwise lamb would become less tasting.

5. Add potato, stir fry for 2 or 3 min

6. Add cabbage, stir fry for 2 min

7. Add red pepper, stir fry for 2 min

8. Add tomatoes, stir fry for 5 min or until the juice of tomato comes out nicely

9. Add parsley, stir fry briefly

10. Add water to cover all goodies, add garlic, allow it to boil for 5-10 min or so. Add salt to taste

#### Noodle preparation

Cut the dough into few pieces, roll each piece into long thin band, On top of each layer, brush with plenty of vegetable oil to keep them from sticking to each other. Follow the pictures for instructions

Roll each band into long round thinner band and roll onto a plate as below. Start with inner most layer, then next outer layer.

Brush the top of circled dough with plenty of oil, cover with plastic wrap, keep at room temperature for 30 min. If you feel your dough is still a bit hard after 30 min, keep it a bit longer, so it is easier to stretch.

Pull out the rolling band from one end, stretch it to even thinner onto the wooden board

Roll the noodle on hands, press hard on the wooden board, press it few times, press it till you see some noodle is almost broken.

Boil water in a pot. Add salt.

Then toss the stretched noodle in the pre-boiled water, Very important step here is make sure you stir the noodle thoroughly by chopstick or folk. This way your noodle will not stick to each other. Cover the pot, allow it to boil. Open the lid, let it continue boiling for 3 more minutes

Take out the noodle from the pot

Toss the noodle into another container with cold water to cool down the noodle a little. Depends on if the person you are serving prefers cold, warm or hot noodle, you can cool the noodle accordingly

Place one person portion on a plate, you need to break the noodle by hand if it is too much. Add about 1/2 cup lamb stew on top and serve. Laghman needs to be served to each individual one by one, it tastes great when it is fresh.

If you feel your noodle turned out a bit bland, add some extra salt to the boiling water. So your next batch noodle will turn out better. And this water after boiling noodle can also be served as soup. We were told since we were kids that it helps digest laghman.
