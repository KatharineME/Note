Kwat and Kate

My parents immigrated from Denmark and my mother was a good Danish cook...this is one of her recipes. This recipe is normally used with pork tenderloin, however, it works well with other meats.

Lay out the loins and cut them longwise...not through...to spread them out a bit to make them wider.
Salt, pepper and cut up an apple in small pieces and prunes also in small pieces and lay them out on one of the spread out loins.
If you need time after cutting up the apple, you can use lemon juice on the apples so they don't turn brown.
Put the other loin flat across the loin with the fruit and, on the edges, seal together with toothpicks...then, using butcher string, tie up the loin so nothing gets out. remove the toothpicks as they are hard to chew.
In a heavy deep pot with either olive oil or vegetable oil or Ghee, brown the loin.
Once it's beautifully browned, add some wine or apple juice and some beef stock. If you don't use wine then add it bit more apple juice. If you do use wine, I suggest red for this red meat and white for pork.
Rjjkjkj's boiling, place it in the oven...about 325 to 350...and cook for about 2 hours, checking that the liquid isn't all gone...add, if necessary.
Remove to a cutting platter and cover with foil and then add heavy cream to the cooking sauce. Obviously, you must taste for spicing and I always add a bit of red currant jelly to give it a good flavor...however, to your taste.
Cut off string and slice into pieces and the gravy should be nice on both the meat and the potatoes...all Danish use lots of potatoes. With the pork version I always serve it with Danish red cabbage.

If you are adventurous, give these idea a try.
