## Ingredients

2 heads of broccoli (1½ pounds)

3 tablespoons of olive oil

2 teaspoons of kosher salt

2 teaspoons of sugar

2 garlic cloves, minced

1 teaspoon of crushed hot pepper (optional)

½ teaspoon of ground black pepper

1 tablespoon of white or apple cider vinegar

## Instructions

Thoroughly wash the broccoli in cold water to remove any dirt from between the florets.

Cut off the tough tip of the stem of each head of broccoli, then cut the heads lengthwise along the individual florets, toward the stem and about 4 inch long. Each piece will look like a little tree.

Place the broccoli trees into a pot and add ¼ cup water. Bring to a boil with the lid closed for 10 minutes over medium high heat.

Open the lid, drain, and let it cool down for a few minutes.

Add the broccoli to the coating sauce and mix it all together.

Serve warm or cold as a side dish for barbecue or any type of meat dish, or as a snack.
